I am passionate about Full Stack Developer, and to witness both of these fields impacting our daily lives baffles me and feeds into my curiosity.

I am also a Full Stack Web Developer with experience in Deloitte, I have worked on .Net and Angular.

Being ever curious, I have recently started working on Leet coder with .Net, Java, and Python.

I understand the fast-paced nature of the tech field and I have made myself compatible with it, I am a fast learner and have gone beyond my academic curriculum to learn many skills.
